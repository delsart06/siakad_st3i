<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a comprehensive web-based SIAKAD (Sistem Informasi Akademik) for a university. The user provided a detailed, multi-module specification, structured from foundational data to managerial dashboards. The initial request specified a Laravel + MySQL stack.

After clarification, the user agreed to the following for the MVP:
- **Tech Stack**: FastAPI (Backend), React (Frontend), MongoDB (Database)
- **Modules**: Master Data, User & Access, and Akademik Core
- **Authentication**: JWT-based custom auth (username/password)
- **Language**: Indonesian
- **Design**: Modern & Minimalist

**User's preferred language**: Bahasa Indonesia

**what currently exists?**
A functional MVP of the SIAKAD application has been built. The backend is powered by FastAPI and the frontend by React with Shadcn UI components.
Key features implemented include:
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based login for different user roles (Admin, Dosen, Mahasiswa).
-   **Admin Dashboard**: Management of all master data including Tahun Akademik, Fakultas, Prodi, Mata Kuliah, Mahasiswa, and Dosen.
-   **Student Portal**: Students can view their profile, see available courses, enroll in courses for their Kartu Rencana Studi (KRS), and view their Kartu Hasil Studi (KHS) and Transkrip Nilai.
-   **Lecturer (Dosen) Portal**: Lecturers who are Academic Advisors (Dosen PA) can view and validate (approve/reject) KRS submissions from their assigned students.

**Last working item**:
The agent was addressing a user report claiming that the Dosen PA was not receiving KRS submissions from their students for validation. This report came immediately after the agent had successfully implemented, tested, and demonstrated the entire KRS submission and validation flow. The agent's last action was to investigate this by setting up new test data to re-verify the flow.

    - Last item agent was working: Re-verifying the KRS validation flow for Dosen PA (Academic Advisor) after a user report indicated it was not working. The agent suspected a data setup issue or user misunderstanding, as previous tests were successful. The plan was to create a new class, have a test student submit a new KRS, and check if it appears for the Dosen PA.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: Y
    - Which testing method agent to use? manual testing by curl
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Dosen PA cannot see KRS submissions for validation. (Priority: P0)
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - **Description**: The user reported that the feature for Dosen PA to validate KRS is not working, even though the agent's tests (including screenshots) showed a successful end-to-end flow. The agent was in the middle of re-creating test data to debug this. It's possible the data state was changed or the user is checking with the wrong data.
     - **Attempted fixes**: The agent had previously created comprehensive test data and successfully simulated the entire flow:
        1. Student enrolls in a course -> Status: .
        2. Dosen PA logs in and sees the pending request.
        3. Dosen PA approves the request -> Status: .
        4. Student sees the approved status.
     - **Next debug checklist**: 
        1. Ensure there is a student with a pending KRS () and an assigned Dosen PA. The last agent created a student Midel with a pending KRS but no Dosen PA. This needs to be fixed.
        2. **Action**: Assign a Dosen PA to the student Midel or have the existing test student Budi Santoso () submit a *new* KRS for another course.
        3. Verify in the  collection that a document exists with .
        4. Log in as the assigned Dosen PA ().
        5. Navigate to the  page.
        6. Confirm if the pending KRS appears. Use the screenshot tool to verify.
        7. If it still doesn't appear, inspect the backend API endpoint  in  and the frontend fetching logic in .
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a critical core feature of the academic workflow. Without it, students cannot have their course plans officially approved.
     - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
     - **Is recurring issue?**: Y
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - No separate in-progress tasks. The current focus is on the P0 issue above.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend**: FastAPI
-   **Frontend**: React, React Router, Context API for state management.
-   **Database**: MongoDB (accessed via  async driver).
-   **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with role-based authorization.
-   **UI**: Shadcn/UI components with Tailwind CSS.

**key DB schema**
-   **users**: 
-   **mahasiswa**: 
-   **dosen**: 
-   **prodi**: 
-   **fakultas**: 
-   **matakuliah**: 
-   **kelas**:

**changes in tech stack**
-   The user's original request for Laravel + MySQL was changed to FastAPI + React + MongoDB after confirmation.

**All files of reference**
-   : The single file containing all backend logic, including models, API routes, and database interactions.
-   : Main frontend router defining application pages and routes.
-   : Centralized Axios instance for all frontend API calls.
-   : Manages user authentication state and JWT tokens.
-   : Frontend logic for students to enroll in courses.
-   : Frontend logic for academic advisors to validate KRS.
-   : Admin page for managing student data, including assignment of Dosen PA.
-   : Project requirements document.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The backend logic in  is becoming very large. Consider splitting routes, models, and services into separate files/modules for better maintainability as the application grows.

**key api endpoints**
-   : User login.
-   : Get current user profile.
-   : CRUD endpoints for all master data.
-   : GET, POST, DELETE student's KRS entries.
-   : GET available classes for a student.
-   : GET student's semester grades.
-   : GET student's full transcript.
-   : GET pending KRS for advisor's students.
-   : Approve a KRS.
-   : Reject a KRS.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The immediate task is to resolve the user's report that the Dosen PA validation is not working. Do not assume the feature is broken. The agent has already proven the flow works. Your first step should be to carefully re-verify the data state. There's a high probability that the test student's KRS is no longer in a pending state (), or the Dosen PA being used for login is not assigned to the student with the pending KRS. Follow the debug checklist for the P0 issue.
-   Respond to the user in **Bahasa Indonesia**.
